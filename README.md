# Salary Prediction Using Polynomial Regression

This section provides an example of predicting salary based on experience using a Polynomial Regression model. Polynomial Regression is useful for capturing non-linear relationships between the predictor and response variables.

## Data Model

We use a Polynomial Regression model, which extends linear regression by adding polynomial terms to model non-linear relationships.

## How to Use

1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

2. Run the script to train the model and predict the salary for a given number of years of experience.

3. Modify the `experience` and `salaries` arrays with your dataset to fit the model to your specific data.
